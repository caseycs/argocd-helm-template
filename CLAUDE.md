This is CLI tool written in python to render argocd applications.

Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

Ignore all files mentioned in .gitignore.
